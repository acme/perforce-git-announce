London, UK - Perl announces that it has migrated its code to the Git
version control system.

Open Source becomes more open as the Perl programming language welcomes
a new generation of programmers by using the Git version control system.

Perl 5 is a high-level, general-purpose, dynamic programming
language. Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall, a linguist working
as a systems administrator for NASA. It was meant to be a general purpose
Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Many companies
now use Perl 5 extensively; among them are the British Broadcasting
Corporation, Amazon.com, LiveJournal, Ticketmaster, Craigslist and IMDb.

Perl 1.000 was first released on December 18th 1987, 21 years ago today.
The most recent major version of Perl 5 (5.10.0) was released one year
ago today.

Originally, Perl was developed using the Revision Control System (RCS). In
March 1997, Perl moved to using the Perforce Software Configuration
Management System. The Perforce repository was graciously hosted and
maintained, free of charge, by ActiveState. As an open source project,
Perl received a no-cost license for Perforce, which enabled the
development of Perl for the last ten years.

Git is an open source version control system designed to handle very large
projects with speed and efficiency. Like Perl, Git is highly flexible
and extensible. Perl's motto, "There's More Than One Way To Do It!" is
a good fit for Git, too.

Perforce provided the core developers with powerful tools, but these
tools were not available to users outside the core team. The migration
to Git will open Perl 5 development up to the widest audience of
possible contributors by removing any barriers to access. Git provides
an integrated repository browser and can be accessed over a number of
different protocols.

The Perl Git repostiory includes every version of Perl ever released,
as well as ever revision ever made during development. With a public
repository and Git's extensive support for distributed and offline
work, working on Perl's source becomes easier for everyone involved.
Core committers have less administrative work to do, developers outside
the core team can easily work on experimental branches, and a vast array
of improved repository analysis tools are now available.

The Perl 5 Git repository is located at http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git

The hardware behind this URL and the systems administration time to
maintain it is donated by Booking.com. Booking.com has also recently
donated $50,000 to The Perl Foundation, to aid in the further development
and maintenance of the Perl programming language in general, and Perl
5.10 in particular.

Many thanks to everyone involved in this project, especially Sam Vilain
who did all the hard work in performing the Perforce conversion and
merging of all the historical versions of Perl that were floating on
the internet, producing the first ever unified repository of all the
Perl changes.
