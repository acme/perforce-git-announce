Title: Perl now uses Git for version control

HOLLAND, Michigan - The Perl Foundation has migrated Perl 5 to the Git
version control system.

More programmers than ever can now benefit from Perl. Benefits include:

- With a public repository and Git's extensive support for distributed
and offline work, working on Perl 5's source becomes easier for everyone
involved.

- Everyone can now access the Perl 5 development tools, not just the
core Perl team as before.

- Core committers have less admin work to do, developers outside the
core team can easily work on experimental branches.

- Vast array of improved repository analysis tools are now available.

- Access over many protocols.

- Includes every version of Perl 5 ever released, as well as every
revision made during development.

The Perl 5 Git repository is located at http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git

In true open source style, the conversion to Git was done by Sam Vilain
both in his spare time and time donated by his employer, Catalyst IT. He
spent more than one year writing custom tools to transform 21 years of
historical Perl versions to produce the first ever unified repository
of every single change to Perl.

Perl 5 is used by many businesses including the BBC, Amazon.com,
LiveJournal, Ticketmaster, Craigslist and IMDb. It was originally
developed by Larry Wall, a linguist working as a systems administrator for
NASA. Perl grew into a high-level, general-purpose, dynamic programming
language and is now used primarily in website development.

Perl 1.000 was released on December 18th 1987 - 21 years ago. The most
recent major version of Perl 5 (5.10.0) was released one year ago.

Git is an open source version control system designed to handle very
large projects with speed and efficiency. Started by Linus Torvalds, the
inventor of Linux, in order to handle the vast number of contributions
to the Linux Kernel, Git is highly flexible and extensible. Perl's motto,
"There's More Than One Way To Do It!" perfectly matches the Git workflow.

Nicholas Clark, the manager for Perl 5.8.9 which was released this week
said "I'm looking forward to Git giving me the ability to work either
online or offline. Perforce is great when I have a network connection,
but until now those times when I've been trying to develop on trains
or planes, at stations or airports, I'm back in the 'dark ages' before
version control. Git solves this problem and more".

The hardware behind this and the systems administration time to maintain
it is donated by Booking.com. Booking.com has also recently donated
$50,000 to The Perl Foundation, to aid in the further development and
maintenance of the Perl programming language in general, and Perl 5.10
in particular.

Perl originally used the Revision Control System (RCS) until March
1997 when it switched to the Perforce Software Configuration Management
System. The Perforce repository was graciously hosted and maintained,
free of charge, by ActiveState. Perforce provided the core developers
with powerful tools, but these tools were not available to users outside
the core team. The switch to Git removes this barrier.
