London, UK - Perl announces that it has migrated its version control
system to Git.

Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming
language. Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall, a linguist working
as a systems administrator for NASA, in 1987, as a general purpose Unix
scripting language to make report processing easier.

Perl 1.000 was first released on December 18th 1987, 21 years ago today.

Originally, Perl was developed using the Revision Control System (RCS). In
1997, Perl moved to using the Perforce Software Configuration Management
System on servers and sysadmin time donated by ActiveState.

Git is an open source version control system designed to handle very
large projects with speed and efficiency. Like Perl, Git has lots of
flexibility, "There's More Than One Way To Do It", and extensibility.

Booking.com is donating hardware and sysadmin time to provide the
servers for the new git master for Perl 5.

Booking.com has recently donated $50,000 to The Perl Foundation, to
aid in the further development and maintenance of the Perl programming
language in general, and Perl 5.10 in particular.

The Perl Git repository is located at http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git
