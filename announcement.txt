London, UK - Perl announces that it has migrated its code to the Git
version control system.

Perl 5 is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming
language. Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall, a linguist working
as a systems administrator for NASA, in 1987, as a general purpose Unix
scripting language to make report processing easier.

Perl 1.000 was first released on December 18th 1987, 21 years ago today,
the latest version of Perl 5.8 (5.8.9) was released three days ago on
December 15th 2008.

Originally, Perl was developed using the Revision Control System (RCS). In
March 1997, Perl moved to using the Perforce Software Configuration
Management System on servers and sysadmin time donated by ActiveState.

Git is an open source version control system designed to handle very
large projects with speed and efficiency. Like Perl, Git has lots of
flexibility, "There's More Than One Way To Do It", and extensibility.

The migration to Git will open Perl 5 development up to the widest
audience of possible contributors by removing any barriers to access. Git
provides an integrated repository browser and can be accessed over a
number of different protocols.

Using Git also opens up the full repository (including every version
ever released), allows development while disconnected from the internet,
reduces the workload on core committers, allows experimental projects to
operate under version control, aids integration of branches maintained
outside the official repository, and generally makes more advanced
toolsets available to our developers and our committers.

The Perl 5 Git repository is located at http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git

The hardware behind this URL and sysadmin time to maintain it is donated
by Booking.com. Booking.com has also recently donated $50,000 to The
Perl Foundation, to aid in the further development and maintenance of
the Perl programming language in general, and Perl 5.10 in particular.
